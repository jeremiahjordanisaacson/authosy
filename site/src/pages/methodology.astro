    <p>
      Transparency matters. Here is exactly how Authosy discovers, verifies,
      and publishes each story.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Discovery</h2>
    <p>
      We monitor RSS feeds from dozens of reputable news outlets covering Seattle,
      national US news, and world news. The full list of sources is available on
      the <a href={`${base}sources/`}>Sources page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Positivity filtering</h2>
    <p>
      Each candidate story is evaluated by an AI classifier that scores its
      positivity on a 0&ndash;1 scale. Only stories scoring above 0.6 proceed.
      This filters out crime reports, political conflict, disasters, and
      sensationalism.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Multi-source verification</h2>
    <p>
      We cluster related stories using TF-IDF cosine similarity on their titles
      and descriptions. A story must appear in at least two distinct reputable
      sources to be published. This ensures we are not amplifying single-source
      rumors or press releases.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Rewriting</h2>
    <p>
      An AI rewrites each verified story in Authosy's voice. The rules are strict:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No copying of original paragraphs&mdash;all phrasing is original.</li>
      <li>Minimal short quotes only when necessary for attribution.</li>
      <li>Tone is optimistic and grounded, never sensational.</li>
      <li>No political commentary or editorial opinion.</li>
      <li>500&ndash;900 words.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Source attribution</h2>
    <p>
      Every published story includes direct links to all corroborating sources.
      We encourage readers to read the original reporting.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Scoring</h2>
    <p>
      Each story carries two scores:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Positivity score</strong> (0&ndash;1): How uplifting the story is.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidence score</strong> (0&ndash;1): How confident we are in multi-source
        verification.</li>
    </ul>
