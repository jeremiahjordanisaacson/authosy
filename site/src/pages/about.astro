    <p>
      Authosy is an automated uplifting news service. We believe that positive stories
      deserve the same rigorous verification as any other journalism. Our system discovers
      good news from reputable sources, confirms each story through multiple independent
      reports, and rewrites it in a clear, optimistic voice.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      Every hour, our automated service scans dozens of trusted news feeds for stories
      with a positive angle. It filters out negativity and sensationalism, then clusters
      related reports to ensure that every story we publish is corroborated by at least
      two distinct reputable sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once verified, each story is rewritten in our own voice: grounded, optimistic,
      and free of political slant. The original sources are always linked so you can
      read the full reporting yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>Why "Authosy"?</h2>
    <p>
      The name blends "authentic" and "rosy"&mdash;because we think the world
      genuinely has good news to share, and it deserves to be told authentically.
