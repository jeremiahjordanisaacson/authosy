For millennia, humans have sought inner peace through meditation, and now modern science is catching up to what ancient practitioners long intuited. A recent study conducted in Iowa suggests that the benefits of transcendental meditation extend far deeper than simple relaxation—all the way down to our genetic expression.

Researchers at Maharishi International University have published findings showing that transcendental meditation appears to quiet the activity of genes associated with stress responses. Perhaps more intriguingly, these same genes have now been linked to markers of biological aging, opening the door to the possibility that this ancient practice could influence how our bodies age at the molecular level.

## Inside the Study

The research team designed their investigation around four distinct groups of participants, each containing 25 individuals from the Fairfield, Iowa area where the university is located. The groups were divided by age and meditation experience: young adults between 20 and 32 years old who practiced transcendental meditation, young non-practitioners, older adults between 55 and 72 who meditated regularly, and older individuals who did not practice meditation.

The scientists examined 15 specific genes that serve as indicators for stress response and aging processes. Among younger meditation practitioners, the results were striking—13 of those 15 genes showed reduced expression compared to their non-meditating peers. The older meditators also demonstrated benefits, with 7 of the 15 genes showing dampened activity relative to their control group.

These genetic markers play roles in crucial bodily functions including inflammation control, energy metabolism, mitochondrial performance, and the stability of DNA in cell nuclei. When these genes become overactive, the researchers note, they have been connected to various age-related diseases.

## The Mind-Body Connection at the Cellular Level

The study also examined cognitive function among participants, finding additional promising signals. Older practitioners of transcendental meditation demonstrated better cognitive abilities and faster mental processing speeds when compared to non-practitioners of similar ages. This suggests that the benefits of long-term meditation practice may extend to protecting brain function as we grow older.

The findings build upon decades of research into how meditation affects our bodies' stress systems. Scientists have long understood that meditation influences neurophysiological pathways, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis—the system that governs our fight-or-flight responses. By calming these systems, meditation appears to reduce the wear and tear that chronic stress places on our bodies over time.

Transcendental meditation itself involves a relatively simple practice: silently repeating a mantra or specific sound for 15 to 20 minutes, twice daily. This uniformity has made it particularly useful for scientific study, as researchers can be confident that participants are engaging in consistent practices.

## What This Means for Everyday Practitioners

While this single study cannot prove that meditation definitively slows aging, it adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that contemplative practices offer measurable physiological benefits beyond stress relief and relaxation. The connection between stress-response genes and aging markers is itself a relatively new finding, opening fresh avenues for understanding how lifestyle choices might influence our biological clocks.

The researchers acknowledge that transcendental meditation serves as a proxy for meditative practices more broadly in scientific literature. There is reasonable hope that other established forms of meditation—including mindfulness practices, Zen traditions, and various contemplative disciplines with centuries of anecdotal support—might produce comparable effects on genetic expression.

Meditation has journeyed from ancient spiritual practice to subject of rigorous scientific inquiry over the past several decades. What began as a way to seek enlightenment or inner peace is now revealing its secrets under the microscope, one gene at a time. For the millions who already incorporate meditation into their daily routines, this research offers scientific validation. For those who have yet to begin, it presents one more compelling reason to find a quiet spot, close their eyes, and breathe.
