A centuries-old masterwork depicting a resting lion has found new purpose in the modern fight for wildlife survival. Dr. Thomas S. Kaplan and his wife have sold their prized Rembrandt drawing at Sotheby's for a staggering $17.9 million, with every dollar directed toward protecting the very animal the Dutch master captured on paper nearly four hundred years ago.

The sale represents far more than an art transaction—it marks a creative fusion of cultural heritage and environmental stewardship that could help secure the future of one of Earth's most iconic species.

## A Masterpiece Returns to Market After a Century

The drawing, titled *Young Lion Resting*, stands as one of only six known lion studies created by Rembrandt van Rijn. What makes this particular work exceptional is its provenance: it remained the sole lion drawing by the artist to have ever been held in a private collection, and its appearance at auction marks the first time a Rembrandt drawing has come to market in over one hundred years.

The $17.9 million hammer price shattered previous records, exceeding the prior benchmark for a Rembrandt drawing by nearly $15 million. The piece showcases the artist's extraordinary ability to render life through seemingly effortless strokes, capturing the relaxed confidence of a young lion with remarkable economy of line and masterful shading that brings the animal's penetrating gaze to vivid reality.

Dr. Kaplan, who acquired the drawing in 2004, recalls the moment his wife first saw the work. When asked her opinion before the purchase, she responded simply: "It's a Rembrandt, it's a lion, and it's beautiful. If it's not for you, then who's it for?" The piece became the most expensive object the couple had ever acquired as they built what would become the renowned Leiden Collection of Dutch and Flemish masterworks.

## Art in Service of Conservation

The timing of this sale carries deep significance. Dr. Kaplan founded Panthera, now recognized as the world's preeminent organization dedicated exclusively to wild cat conservation, just one year after purchasing the drawing. The organization celebrates its twentieth anniversary in 2026, making this moment particularly poignant.

To underscore the urgency of their mission, Sotheby's paired the original artwork with a powerful companion piece titled *Young Lion Vanished*. This faithful reproduction replaces the lion Rembrandt so skillfully depicted with an empty void—a stark visual representation of the species' disappearance across 95 percent of its historical range.

"Is it savable? Yes, it is," Dr. Kaplan affirmed when discussing the lion's prospects. However, he noted the sobering reality that the species has already vanished from 26 of the 48 countries where it once roamed freely. While he expressed confidence that lions will never become fully extinct in the wild, he voiced concern that without intervention, they may eventually survive only within isolated protected areas rather than across connected landscapes.

Jon Ayers, who co-owned the drawing and serves as chair of Panthera's board of directors, reflected on the deeper meaning behind the sale. He observed that the vitality Rembrandt captured in the lion's expression continues to resonate through the conservation work the proceeds will fund. The resources generated will prove essential in combating poaching and habitat destruction across approximately forty countries spanning four continents.

## Protecting Wildlife Through Human Partnership

Panthera's approach to conservation extends well beyond simply protecting animals. Dr. Kaplan emphasized that roughly eighty percent of the organization's efforts focus on working directly with local communities to prevent human-wildlife conflict before it escalates to violence.

The logic is straightforward but profound. When a family's entire livelihood depends on a single cow or goat, the loss of that animal to a predator creates an understandable desire for retaliation. However, when communities receive support in protecting their livestock through practical measures like improved fencing, the impulse to kill big cats diminishes dramatically.

"If people don't have to kill lions, usually they don't," Dr. Kaplan explained. This empathetic understanding of rural communities' practical concerns has shaped Panthera's model of conservation through coexistence rather than confrontation.

## A Legacy in Safe Paws

The record-breaking auction represents a remarkable convergence of passions. Dr. Kaplan and his wife have demonstrated how cultural treasures can serve purposes beyond aesthetic appreciation, transforming a beloved artwork into a lifeline for endangered wildlife.

Panthera has already achieved significant success in protecting leopards and jaguars across their ranges. The organization now turns additional attention and resources toward ensuring lions can thrive beyond isolated strongholds, maintaining the connectivity between populations that healthy species require.

Those familiar with Panthera's track record within conservation circles share a common assessment: if this organization cannot save a wild cat species, no one can. With nearly $18 million now flowing toward that mission, the magnificent creature Rembrandt immortalized in ink and wash centuries ago stands a far better chance of surviving for centuries more.
