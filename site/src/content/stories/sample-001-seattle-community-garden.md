What was once a forgotten patch of gravel and weeds in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood has blossomed into something remarkable. The Olive Way Community Garden, which opened its gates last Saturday, represents months of collaborative effort between longtime residents, local businesses, and the city's Department of Neighborhoods.

## From vacant lot to vibrant gathering place

The transformation began last spring when a group of neighbors noticed the lot at the corner of Olive Way and Belmont Avenue had sat unused for more than three years. Rather than wait for commercial development, they submitted a proposal to the city's community garden program and got to work.

Over the following months, more than sixty volunteers contributed their time to clear debris, build raised beds, install an irrigation system, and plant the first round of vegetables and native flowers. Local nurseries donated soil amendments and seedlings, while a Capitol Hill hardware store provided materials at cost.

## Growing more than vegetables

The garden's organizers designed the space with intention. Twenty-four raised beds are available for individual families, while a large communal plot will grow produce for the Capitol Hill Food Bank. There is a children's area with sunflowers and strawberry plants at kid-friendly heights, and a small covered pavilion for neighborhood gatherings.

"We wanted this to be more than a place to grow tomatoes," explained the garden's coordinator during the opening celebration. "It's a place where people who might never otherwise meet can work side by side and build real connections."

The response has been enthusiastic. All twenty-four family beds were claimed within a week of opening registration, and a waitlist has already formed. Weekend volunteer sessions for the communal plot regularly draw fifteen to twenty participants.

## A model for other neighborhoods

Seattle's Department of Neighborhoods has taken notice. The Olive Way garden is the twelfth community garden to open in the city in the past two years, part of a broader effort to increase green space in dense urban neighborhoods. City officials have pointed to Capitol Hill's success as a model for streamlining the application and permitting process.

The garden also incorporates sustainable practices that the city hopes to see replicated elsewhere. Rainwater collection barrels supply much of the irrigation water, composting stations process garden waste on-site, and all plantings use organic methods.

## What comes next

As the growing season begins in earnest, the garden committee has planned a series of workshops on topics from container gardening to seed saving. A partnership with a local elementary school will bring students to the garden for hands-on science lessons starting in March.

For a neighborhood that has undergone rapid change in recent years, the Olive Way Community Garden offers something increasingly rare: a quiet, green space where the pace slows down and neighbors can simply enjoy being neighbors.
