When a frantic man burst through the doors of the Woodstown Police Department in New Jersey, Officers Benjamin Haines and Gabriel Chiarelli had no idea what emergency awaited them. The man was shouting and gesturing urgently, but neither officer could understand a word he was saying. Without hesitation, they followed him outside to his vehicle—and discovered a situation neither had ever trained for.

In the backseat sat a woman in active labor, moments away from giving birth.

## A Race Against Time

The officers quickly realized they faced two significant challenges: a baby that wasn't going to wait for an ambulance, and a language barrier that made direct communication nearly impossible. Neither the expectant mother nor the father spoke English, and the officers had no translation training or multilingual skills to draw upon.

But modern technology offered an unexpected lifeline. Both Haines and Chiarelli pulled out their smartphones and opened Google Translate, attempting to provide instructions and reassurance to the laboring mother. When the app struggled to keep pace with the urgency of the moment, the officers pivoted to something more universal—hand gestures, calm tones, and simple demonstrations of breathing techniques.

The approach worked. Despite having no formal medical training in childbirth, Haines coached the mother through her contractions with patience and encouragement.

"I just told her to breathe and push, and she did and out came the head," Haines later explained to local news station 6ABC.

## A Healthy Arrival

Within minutes, a healthy baby girl entered the world in the backseat of that car, right there in the police station parking lot. The officers wrapped both mother and newborn in blankets to keep them warm while they waited for emergency medical services to arrive on scene.

By the time paramedics reached the station, the most critical work had already been done. Mother and daughter were stable, comfortable, and ready to be transported to a nearby hospital for proper medical evaluation. The baby was reportedly in excellent health, and the new mother was doing well despite the unexpected circumstances of her delivery.

Chiarelli admitted that the entire experience caught them completely off guard. The officer recalled opening the car door and immediately realizing the baby was already crowning—there would be no time to call for backup or wait for trained medical professionals. The situation demanded immediate action, and both officers rose to the occasion without hesitation.

## Serving Beyond the Badge

For Haines and Chiarelli, the experience reinforced exactly why they joined the police force in the first place. While their typical duties might involve traffic stops, responding to disturbances, or investigating crimes, both officers expressed that helping people in their most vulnerable moments represents the true heart of their profession.

Their station chief praised the officers for their quick thinking and calm demeanor under pressure, noting that they responded to an unprecedented situation with professionalism and compassion. Neither officer had ever delivered a baby before, yet they approached the challenge with the same dedication they bring to every call for help.

The story also highlights the remarkable ways technology can bridge divides between people. Google Translate, a tool many use for travel or casual communication, became a vital medical instrument in those critical moments. When words failed, human instinct and the universal language of care took over, proving that compassion transcends any linguistic boundary.

For one New Jersey family, a terrifying emergency transformed into a story they'll tell for generations—about the two police officers who didn't let anything, not even a language barrier, stop them from bringing a new life safely into the world. And somewhere in that town, a little girl will grow up knowing her first moments were guided by the steady hands of strangers who simply refused to give up on helping her family.
