In what reads like a plot from a detective novel set in the art world, a significant Renaissance painting has emerged from obscurity at a private estate in Durham, North Carolina. The work, titled *Portrait of a Canon Regular*, was created by Sofonisba Anguissola in 1552—and until recently, the art world believed it had been lost to history forever.

The painting's journey back into the spotlight began with a simple YouTube video. Art historian Michael Cole had recorded a lecture about Anguissola, discussing her remarkable life and artistic achievements. A pair of art collectors in Durham happened upon the video, and as they listened to Cole describe the Renaissance master's distinctive style, a realization began to dawn on them: they might already own one of her works.

## A Serendipitous Connection

The collectors reached out to Cole with their suspicions, extending an invitation for him to examine the piece in person. When the historian arrived in North Carolina and studied the canvas before him, his analysis confirmed what the collectors had hoped—this was indeed *Portrait of a Canon Regular*, a painting that had last been documented in a black-and-white photograph taken in 1920. For 104 years, the artwork had existed in a kind of limbo, present in the physical world but absent from scholarly knowledge.

The portrait depicts a priest mid-sermon, delivering words from the Gospel of John. Over his right shoulder, a spectral eagle bearing a halo hovers in the composition—the traditional symbol associated with St. John the Evangelist. Anguissola painted this work when she was just twenty years old, already demonstrating the mastery of portraiture that would define her celebrated career.

## The Illustrious Woman of Cremona

Sofonisba Anguissola occupied a singular position in the art world of her era. Born into a noble family in Cremona, in northern Italy, she received encouragement from her father to pursue artistic training at a young age—an unusual opportunity for women of the sixteenth century. Her talents drew the attention of contemporaries, including the renowned artist and biographer Giorgio Vasari, who praised her ability to work "with deeper study and greater grace than any woman of our times."

Her reputation eventually carried her to the Spanish court, where she served as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elisabeth while simultaneously producing portraits of the royal family. Her depiction of King Philip II remains on display at the Prado Museum in Madrid to this day. Yet art historians have long noted that her time in Spain came with creative constraints—each royal portrait had to conform to established stylistic conventions. This reality makes her earlier Italian works, created before those restrictions took hold, particularly prized among collectors and scholars.

Anguissola lived an extraordinarily long life for her time, reaching the age of ninety-three. Her second husband, Orazio Lomellino, was so devoted to her memory that he commissioned a tomb inscription honoring her as one of the "illustrious women of the world, outstanding in portraying the images of man."

## A Rare Signed Work Returns to View

The rediscovered painting carries additional significance beyond its historical and artistic merit. *Portrait of a Canon Regular* bears Anguissola's signature—a detail present on only about twenty known canvases from her hand. Such signed works are exceptionally scarce, making this find all the more remarkable for the study of her artistic legacy.

The painting made its public debut at the Winter Show, an annual art fair held at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan. Visitors to the exhibition had the rare opportunity to view a work that had been invisible to the art world for over a century. The piece was offered for sale at a price of half a million dollars, reflecting both its historical importance and its rarity.

For art historians and enthusiasts alike, this rediscovery represents more than just another valuable painting coming to light. It offers a renewed opportunity to appreciate the achievements of an artist who broke barriers in a male-dominated profession and earned recognition that endured across centuries. Sometimes the most meaningful discoveries arrive not through elaborate expeditions or painstaking archival research, but through the simple act of watching a lecture and paying attention to what hangs on one's own walls.
