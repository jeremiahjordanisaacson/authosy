In the heart of America's agricultural belt, an unassuming minnow measuring just a few inches long has become the unlikely catalyst for one of the most successful habitat restoration programs in the Midwest. The Topeka shiner, a small silver and orange fish that once thrived throughout Iowa's waterways, has inspired conservationists to revive hundreds of lost wetlands—and in the process, they've discovered benefits that extend far beyond saving a single species.

## A Landscape Transformed

Before Iowa became synonymous with rolling farmland, the state looked dramatically different. Wetlands once covered roughly eleven percent of the landscape, fed by a dynamic system of rivers that naturally carved new paths after heavy rains. When these rivers shifted course, they left behind distinctive U-shaped bodies of water known as oxbow lakes—named for their resemblance to the curved yoke used on draft animals.

These small, isolated ponds created unique micro-ecosystems where species like the Topeka shiner flourished. However, as agriculture expanded across the state, more than 10,000 of these oxbow lakes were drained, filled, or simply left to deteriorate. The shiner's population collapsed along with its habitat, and by 1998, the federal government placed the species on the Endangered Species List.

Two years later, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service partnered with the Iowa chapter of the Nature Conservancy to begin an ambitious project: identifying and restoring these lost oxbow lakes across the state. Scientists learned to spot the telltale scars in the landscape where oxbows once existed, visible as curved depressions several dozen meters beyond current river bends.

## Unexpected Discoveries

What began as a targeted effort to save one small fish soon revealed something remarkable. After the first twenty or so wetlands were restored, conservationists noticed that agricultural pollutants washing through nearby streams were being captured and filtered by the newly revived oxbows. Nutrients and sediments that would otherwise flow downstream settled harmlessly into the muddy bottoms of these natural filtration systems.

Karen Wilke, associate director of freshwater at the Nature Conservancy in Iowa, has watched the program evolve over the years. The initiative has expanded beyond its original mission to address water quality concerns that affect communities throughout the watershed.

The ecological response has been nothing short of extraordinary. Researchers have documented 57 different fish species making use of the restored wetlands, along with 81 bird species. But the biodiversity extends further still—mussels, turtles, amphibians, beavers, and even river otters have returned to areas where these habitats have been revived.

## Building Momentum

The restoration work requires significant investment, with each wetland costing tens of thousands of dollars to properly rehabilitate. However, a creative funding approach combining private capital, state grants, and federal resources has made the program accessible to landowners without placing financial burden on them. This model has proven essential in a state where 97 percent of land is privately owned.

In 2011, the Iowa Soybean Association joined the effort, partnering with conservation groups to accelerate restoration in the Boone River watershed in north-central Iowa. The involvement of an agricultural trade group underscored how farmers and conservationists could find common ground when the benefits extended to water quality improvements that affected everyone downstream.

Today, more than 200 oxbow lakes have been restored across Iowa's landscape. Surveys show that Topeka shiners have returned to roughly 60 percent of these revived wetlands—a testament to how quickly nature can recover when given the opportunity.

## A Model for the Future

The success has been significant enough that federal wildlife officials are reconsidering the Topeka shiner's status. A 2021 review recommended moving the species from "endangered" to "threatened," which would mark a meaningful milestone in the fish's recovery and stand as validation of the collaborative approach that made it possible.

The Iowa oxbow project offers a compelling template for conservation efforts elsewhere. By starting with a single endangered species, conservationists unlocked a cascade of benefits—cleaner water, restored biodiversity, and engaged landowners willing to participate in stewardship of their own property.

For the little Topeka shiner, survival once depended on the meandering paths of rivers and the quiet pools they left behind. Thanks to the dedication of scientists, conservation groups, farmers, and funding partners across Iowa, those pools are filling once again—and the landscape is coming back to life in ways no one fully anticipated when this work began.
