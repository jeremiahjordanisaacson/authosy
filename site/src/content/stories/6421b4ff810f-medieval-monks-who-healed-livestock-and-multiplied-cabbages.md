Long before modern environmental movements, a group of medieval monks in the Italian countryside were earning reverence for what might be called the original green miracles. New research has brought to light the forgotten stories of Augustinian friars whose legendary feats included healing injured farm animals, commanding fruit trees to bear harvest, and transforming toxic swampland into fertile ground.

The timing of this historical rediscovery carries special significance. The Augustinian Order recently celebrated a milestone when one of its members was elected Pope Leo XIV—the first Augustinian to hold the papacy in the order's eight-hundred-year history.

## A Decade in Dusty Archives

Dr. Krisztina Ilko, a medieval historian at Queen's College, Cambridge, spent ten years piecing together this overlooked chapter of religious history. Her journey took her through two dozen archives and more than sixty Augustinian sites across Italy, including remote ruins that few scholars had ever visited.

Her investigations revealed treasures hidden in frescoes, illuminated manuscripts, and hagiographies—collections of saints' life stories. Some documents had been misdated or incorrectly attributed over the centuries, further obscuring the Augustinians' remarkable legacy.

One of her most significant finds was a collection of Augustinian life stories written by a Florentine friar in the 1320s, housed in Florence's Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana. The manuscript had been largely ignored by previous scholars, who apparently considered its agricultural miracles too rustic to warrant serious attention.

Yet these rural wonders were precisely what made the Augustinians unique. The manuscript describes Giovanni of Florence, who built a hermitage with the help of local farmers and became celebrated for healing the broken leg of an ox. Another friar, Jacopo of Rosia, was credited with commanding an unreliable apple tree to produce fruit every year and miraculously multiplying cabbages for hungry communities.

## Dragon Slayers with Pitchforks

Perhaps the most colorful figure to emerge from Dr. Ilko's research is Guglielmo of Malavalle, a twelfth-century hermit whose story offers a striking contrast to better-known medieval legends.

While Saint George remains famous throughout Christendom as a lance-wielding dragon slayer on horseback, Guglielmo achieved similar legendary status with far humbler tools. According to Augustinian tradition, he defeated a dragon using nothing more than a wooden staff shaped like a pitchfork.

In medieval understanding, dragons represented more than mythical beasts. Their toxic breath was blamed for disease affecting livestock, crops, and people alike. Swampy regions were considered particularly dangerous, their foul air thought to suffocate the countryside and its inhabitants.

Guglielmo settled in Malavalle—literally meaning "bad valley"—in Tuscany's swampy Maremma region. The area was considered so dark and terrible that even hunters avoided it. His legendary dragon-slaying, Dr. Ilko argues, was actually veneration for a very practical achievement: purifying the air and restoring the valley to productive fertility.

These accomplishments were far from symbolic. In an era when a failed harvest or sick livestock could mean starvation, the ability to secure good weather, healthy animals, and abundant crops represented the most desperately needed interventions imaginable.

## Why the Countryside Mattered

The research challenges common assumptions about religious power in medieval Italy. When scholars examine the Church's influence during the Renaissance, attention typically flows toward great cities like Rome, Florence, and Siena. The Franciscans and Dominicans receive credit for driving Italy's rapid urban renewal from the 1200s onward.

Yet the Augustinians drew their authority from an entirely different source. Lacking a charismatic founder or compelling origin story, they built their legitimacy through direct connection with wild spaces—forests, mountains, and seaside territories. These natural power bases provided not only spiritual authority but also access to valuable resources including timber, crops, and wild game.

Their miracles reflected this rural identity. While other orders became associated with urban phenomena like stigmatizations and bleeding hosts, the Augustinians cultivated a reputation for agricultural wonders. A scorched cherry twig miraculously sprouting. A diseased swamp restored to peak fertility. The everyday concerns of country people transformed into holy narrative.

## Relevance for a Modern Age

Dr. Ilko's research, now published in her book "The Sons of St. Augustine: Art and Memory in the Augustinian Churches of Central Italy," arrives at a moment when environmental consciousness has returned to the forefront of global conversation.

The Augustinians' green-fingered legacy offers an unexpected historical perspective on humanity's relationship with the natural world. Eight centuries ago, communities celebrated religious figures not for otherworldly visions but for their ability to work in harmony with the land, restore damaged ecosystems, and ensure the survival of farming communities.

With an Augustinian now leading the Catholic Church, the order's ancient environmental heritage takes on renewed relevance. These forgotten miracles remind us that care for the earth has deep roots in spiritual tradition—and that sometimes the most powerful interventions happen not in grand cathedrals, but in muddy fields where an ox needs healing or a cabbage patch needs multiplying.
