A baby boy in Pennsylvania has made medical history as the first human to receive a CRISPR gene therapy tailored specifically to his individual genetic makeup. The infant, known as KJ, was born with a severe metabolic disorder that left him unable to process protein safely, putting him at constant risk of life-threatening complications. Thanks to pioneering work by researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, KJ has responded remarkably well to treatment and is now living a dramatically improved life.

## A Race Against Time

When KJ entered the world, doctors quickly discovered he had a severe form of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, an extremely rare condition affecting his liver's ability to convert ammonia into urea. In healthy individuals, this conversion process is essential for safely eliminating the toxic byproducts of protein digestion. Without a functioning CPS1 enzyme, ammonia accumulates dangerously in the body, threatening brain damage, liver failure, and worse.

For newborns like KJ, treatment options were painfully limited. Standard care involved strict medications and an extremely restrictive diet that eliminated most protein sources. A liver transplant could offer a potential cure, but KJ's tiny body was far too fragile to endure such an invasive procedure. His parents, Nicole and Kyle Muldoon, faced an agonizing situation with no clear path forward.

That changed when two researchers approached them with an audacious proposal: they believed they could use cutting-edge gene editing technology to correct the specific genetic flaw causing KJ's condition.

## Crafting a One-of-a-Kind Treatment

Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, who directs the Gene Therapy for Inherited Metabolic Disorders Frontier Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Dr. Kiran Musunru from the University of Pennsylvania had spent years preparing for exactly this kind of challenge. Both are members of the NIH-funded Somatic Cell Genome Editing Consortium, a collaborative effort focused on advancing personalized genetic medicine.

Their approach utilized base editing, a refined form of CRISPR technology that allows scientists to make precise single-letter changes to DNA without cutting both strands of the genetic code. The team analyzed KJ's specific genetic variant and designed a custom therapy that would correct the faulty instructions in his liver cells, allowing them to produce the enzyme he desperately needed.

Remarkably, the entire process from design to manufacturing took just six months. The treatment was delivered through lipid nanoparticles, microscopic fat bubbles that ferry the genetic instructions directly to liver cells where they can do their work.

KJ received his first infusion in late February 2025, followed by additional doses in March and April of that year. The results exceeded expectations. The infant tolerated all three infusions without experiencing adverse side effects, and his medical team has since been able to discontinue some of his medications while gradually reintroducing protein into his diet.

## Opening Doors for Millions

The significance of KJ's successful treatment extends far beyond one family's relief. Currently, only two CRISPR-based therapies have received FDA approval, both targeting conditions that affect tens of thousands of patients. The economics and logistics of developing gene therapies have historically favored diseases with larger patient populations, leaving millions of people with ultra-rare genetic disorders without options.

The methodology demonstrated in KJ's case offers a potential blueprint for changing that equation. By creating a scalable framework for rapidly designing and manufacturing personalized treatments, researchers hope to bring the transformative power of gene editing to conditions that affect only handfuls of patients worldwide.

"Years and years of progress in gene editing and collaboration between researchers and clinicians made this moment possible," Dr. Ahrens-Nicklas noted, emphasizing that while KJ represents just one patient, the team hopes he is the first of many to benefit from this individualized approach.

The researchers published their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine, providing the scientific community with a detailed roadmap of their process. Their work demonstrates that bespoke genetic medicine, once the stuff of science fiction, has arrived in clinical reality.

## A Family's Leap of Faith

For Nicole and Kyle Muldoon, agreeing to an experimental treatment for their newborn required tremendous courage. Yet they saw it as the best chance to give their son a fuller life while potentially helping other families facing similar impossible choices.

KJ will require careful monitoring throughout his life, and researchers are continuing to track his progress closely. But for now, the little boy who once faced such a precarious future is described by his medical team as thriving. His story represents not just a personal triumph but a glimpse of what modern medicine may increasingly offer: treatments designed not for populations, but for individuals, precisely crafted to correct the unique genetic circumstances that make each of us who we are.
