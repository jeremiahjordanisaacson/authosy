For more than four decades, writer and astrologer Rob Brezsny has been crafting weekly horoscopes that read less like fortune-telling and more like thoughtful letters from a wise friend. His syndicated column, Free Will Astrology, reaches readers in over a hundred publications each week, offering a distinctive blend of cultural wisdom, psychological insight, and gentle encouragement that has earned him a devoted following across generations.

Brezsny's approach to astrology stands apart from the typical sun-sign predictions found in newspapers and magazines. Rather than delivering vague promises or dire warnings, he weaves together concepts from philosophy, world traditions, and art to help readers reflect on their lives with fresh perspective. His latest weekly installment, released for the week of February 7, 2026, demonstrates this signature style in full bloom.

## Drawing Wisdom from Global Traditions

What makes Brezsny's horoscopes resonate with so many readers is his ability to introduce unfamiliar concepts that illuminate familiar struggles. In his current column, he references the alchemical principle of *solve et coagula*—the idea that transformation requires dissolution before reconstruction—to help Pisces readers embrace periods of uncertainty. For Cancer readers, he invokes the Irish concept of "thin places," those liminal moments where the material and spiritual worlds seem to overlap.

The column also draws from Maori healing practices, Korean textile arts, and Inuit philosophy. Virgo readers learn about *mirimiri*, a Maori approach to wellness that focuses on restoring flow rather than fighting illness. Leo readers are introduced to *jogakbo*, the Korean craft of stitching fabric scraps into something beautiful and functional. Scorpio readers encounter *ajurnarmat*, an Inuktitut word that captures the wisdom of accepting what cannot be changed in order to see new possibilities.

These cross-cultural references serve a purpose beyond mere novelty. By framing everyday challenges through the lens of traditions from around the world, Brezsny reminds readers that the struggles they face—periods of uncertainty, feelings of fragmentation, encounters with immovable obstacles—are universal human experiences that cultures everywhere have developed wisdom to address.

## A Philosophy of Empowerment

The name "Free Will Astrology" reflects Brezsny's core philosophy: that astrology should empower rather than constrain. His horoscopes consistently emphasize personal agency and the capacity for growth. When he tells Aries readers he celebrates their "holy impatience with fakery" and their "refusal to waste precious life-force on enterprises that have gone stale," he is affirming qualities rather than predicting events.

For Gemini readers feeling unsettled by recent changes, Brezsny offers the metaphor of kerf bending—a carpentry technique where small cuts allow wood to curve without breaking. What might feel like diminishment, he suggests, is actually preparation for flexibility. For Capricorn readers carrying heavy responsibilities, he introduces the architectural concept of the flying buttress, encouraging them to seek external support rather than shouldering everything alone.

This empowering approach has helped Free Will Astrology build a readership that often includes people who don't necessarily believe in astrological predictions. Many readers treat the column as a weekly prompt for self-reflection, finding value in Brezsny's literary style and psychological insight regardless of their views on celestial influence.

## A Growing Body of Work

Brezsny's influence extends beyond his weekly column. He is the author of *Pronoia Is the Antidote for Paranoia: How All of Creation Is Conspiring to Shower You with Blessings*, a book that explores his optimistic worldview in depth. His newest work, *Astrology Is Real: Revelations from My Life as an Oracle*, offers readers a look at the experiences and insights that have shaped his distinctive approach to the craft.

In an era when many people feel overwhelmed by uncertainty and negativity, Brezsny's weekly dispatches offer something increasingly rare: a consistent source of encouragement grounded in cultural literacy and genuine care for readers' wellbeing. Whether one approaches his horoscopes as spiritual guidance or simply as thoughtful writing, Free Will Astrology continues to demonstrate that wisdom can arrive in unexpected forms—including a syndicated newspaper column.
