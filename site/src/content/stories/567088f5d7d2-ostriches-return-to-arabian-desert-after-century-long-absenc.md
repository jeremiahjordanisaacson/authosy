For the first time in a century, ostriches are once again striding across the sands of the Arabian Peninsula. Five red-necked ostriches have been released into one of Saudi Arabia's largest nature reserves, bringing back a species that ancient Arab poets celebrated and Roman scholars documented, but which vanished from the region generations ago.

The reintroduction marks a significant milestone for conservation efforts in a part of the world uniquely suited to supporting endangered wildlife. With most of the human population concentrated along coastlines and around oases, the Arabian interior offers millions of acres of undisturbed habitat—a sanctuary for species struggling to survive elsewhere.

## A Historic Homecoming

The red-necked ostrich, historically known as the "camel bird" in Arabic culture, was carefully selected for reintroduction by the Saudi Wildlife Authority and partners working under the ReWild Arabia initiative. Scientists chose this subspecies because it represents the closest living relative of the extinct Arabian ostrich and possesses remarkable adaptations for surviving extreme desert conditions.

The five birds were released into the Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Royal Reserve, a protected area spanning approximately six million acres—making it Saudi Arabia's third-largest nature reserve. The landscape mirrors the harsh, arid environment where ostriches once thrived before hunting and habitat pressures drove them to local extinction around the 1920s.

Andrew Zaloumis, CEO of the reserve, emphasized the deep significance of seeing these towering birds return to land they once called home. The ostrich held a special place in Arabian heritage, symbolizing strength, endurance, and speed in traditional oral histories and storytelling passed down through generations.

## Building a Complete Ecosystem

The ostrich reintroduction is far from an isolated effort. These birds represent the twelfth species restored to the reserve as part of an ambitious goal to bring back 23 animals that once formed the region's native megafauna. The project has already successfully reintroduced species including the Arabian oryx, and managers have plans to eventually restore populations of leopards and cheetahs as well.

In 2024, the reserve celebrated another milestone when it welcomed back the Persian onager, an Asiatic wild ass that had also been absent from the region for roughly a century. Each species plays a specific role in rebuilding ecological balance, and the ostrich brings particularly valuable contributions.

As a keystone species, ostriches help maintain ecosystem health through their daily activities. Their nomadic movements across vast distances make them highly effective at dispersing seeds, carrying them far from parent plants and promoting plant regeneration across the landscape. This behavior increases connectivity between plant populations and supports genetic diversity throughout arid ecosystems.

Beyond seed dispersal, ostriches contribute to nutrient cycling through their foraging habits. As they search for food, they disturb vegetation and aerate soils, while also flushing insects that provide food for other species in the reserve.

## A Refuge for a Critically Endangered Species

The global situation for red-necked ostriches remains precarious. Across their remaining range in Africa's Sahel region, only about 1,000 individuals survive in the wild, leaving the species classified as Critically Endangered. Threats including poaching, habitat loss, and regional instability continue to pressure populations in their traditional African homelands.

Arabia's remote desert landscape offers something increasingly rare for vulnerable wildlife: space and security. The harsh terrain that makes human settlement difficult creates natural protection against poaching, while the reserve's protected status provides legal safeguards. Conservation managers hope the peninsula can serve as a refuge where ostriches can rebuild their numbers, potentially supporting future efforts to strengthen populations elsewhere.

The region's connection to ostriches stretches back millennia. Thousands of ancient rock drawings scattered across Arabia's dry climate depict ostriches alongside other wildlife, evidence that these birds once shared the landscape with early human inhabitants. Those same drawings now serve as a kind of blueprint for conservationists working to restore what was lost.

## Looking Ahead

With the ostrich now running free across Saudi sands, the ReWild Arabia project continues advancing toward its goal of restoring a complete community of native species. Each successful reintroduction builds upon the last, gradually reconstructing ecological relationships that took thousands of years to develop.

The return of such an iconic creature after a century of absence demonstrates what becomes possible when conservation ambition meets suitable habitat and sustained commitment. For the red-necked ostrich, the Arabian desert is no longer just a memory preserved in ancient poetry—it is once again home.
